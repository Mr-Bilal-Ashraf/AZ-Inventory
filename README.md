# AZ-Inventory
We are creating a Web Based Inventory Management System with Django as backend. A new User Will make an account and then can add other users in his account as employees. Main User (Admin) can assign different permissions to his employees. The full project will have a lot of tools to manage Inventory in a shop and also in warehouse.
We will provide it as a Web Service but also on localhosts which can be used on LAN.
